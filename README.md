# <Prework Study Guide>

## Throughout the bootcamp's prework, we were led through instructions to create this webpage, combining all the information into one place. The motivation was simply to learn, and expand my mind in terms of the world of coding. I built this project (even though it wasn't as successful and finalized as I'd like) to be a physical, first stepping stone in the sequence of my coding career. This project contains a few quick facts about each computer language that I've learned throughout prework. While creating this, I learned a lot about myself and coding. I started with little knowledge, and left with a wider expertise. Though the webpage isn't perfect, this will show how far I've come once I complete the bootcamp. 



## Installation

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to showcase the progress of a new coder to a well versed coder. The information within this project can also be used for studying or just quick facts. Each section contains facts about each computer language, though when looking at DevTools, I encountered some complications, of which I'm sure after furthering my knowledge, will make sense. 



## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
